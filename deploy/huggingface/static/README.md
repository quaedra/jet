# Jet server deployment

Browser inference has been removed. This static Space is a deployment status
page and does not download or initialize any model weights.

The `zerogpu/` directory contains the tested server-side Gradio + ZeroGPU app
and `/decide` API. The `api/` directory contains the CPU Docker deployment for
`POST /v1/decide`; see `DEPLOYMENT.md`. Hosting is currently blocked by Hugging
Face account-plan requirements. No paid resources have been enabled.
